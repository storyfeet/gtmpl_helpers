//! The point in this Library is to provide useful helper methods for cases where you really do
//! need the templates to be capable.
//! My personal use case was to be able to generate specific svg layouts from numbers in card
//! files. This meant doing more maths in the template than is common.
//! I've broken up the helpers roughly by subject so it should be easy to find the ones you need.
//!
//! The simplest way to use this is to import the trait and call with_all on a template.
//! ```rust
//! use gtmpl::{Template,Context};
//! use gtmpl_value::{Value,Number};
//!
//! use gtmpl_helpers::THelper;
//! let mut t = Template::default().with_all();
//! t.parse(r#"<rect {{xywh (mul . 5) (add . 11) 40 20 "px"}}/>"#);
//!
//! let s = t.q_render(4).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(s,r#"<rect x="20px" y="15px" width="40px" height="20px" />"#.to_string())
//!
//! ```
//!
//! I wanted to keep the demo function simple, but q render works with anything that impls
//! Into for Value And these can of course be Gtmpl Derived like most things.
//! However that is tricky to demo in a doctest.
//!
//!
